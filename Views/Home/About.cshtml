            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello, My names Michael!</p>
            <p>
                I'm a Northern Illinois University graduate from Rockford, Illinois, with a degree in Computer Science and Software Development.
                I pride myself as a goal oriented individual with a strong value in teamwork, collaboration, and dedication.
                I've always loved discovering and understanding the details about how things work and my passion and dedication is what continues to drive me through life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my years of study I’ve elevated my critical thinking and self-learning abilities so that I’d complete all the tasks given to me.
                In my studies I've gained important experience in relational databases, object oriented programming design, data structure, algorithms, and
                collaboration with classmates to discover web design in a software frameworks class where I worked with ten different popular frameworks.

                        <li>Masters of Science in Computer Science  [GPA: 3.5]</li>

                    &nbsp; At my time in school I've gained first-hand experience programming and coding
                    in various languages. Doing so has given me a solid foundation to start and a launching point to understand
                    the similarities and differences in languages. More Importantly, it's given me a greater
                    understanding of how to learn new things effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; The building blocks of my degree have enabled me to discover and learn the necessary skills to create full stack
                    web applications that utilize backend database servers alongside new and popular web-frameworks. 
                    Some of these frameworks include: Angular, React, Laravel, Spring, Meteor, and .NET. One class in particular 
                    enabled and exposed me to develop and run applications using each of these web-application frameworks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; Since graduating with my degree I have continued to discover and develop new applications. Some of those include:
                    "Azure Cookbook", "Time Management System -- Meteor", "WebAPI/Winform application".
                    Some of these you'll find @Html.ActionLink("here on this portfolio webpage", "index", "Portfolio", null, new { @class = "aboutMePageLink" }).
